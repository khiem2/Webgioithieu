                        As with other kind of software releases, basically canary is technically a test, alpha, beta, whatever you call it. 
                        Has some improvements with quick fixes for previous issues. 
                        Main releases are more stable though it would be releases at a later date than canary. 
                        If you want to have a more stable update go for release, if you want bleeding edge, bugs be damned, go canary

                        like.
                        You can skip any Package that you don't want to be part of your installation.

                How to use debloater.config?
            </div>

            <div class="content">

                    <li>
                        Debloater config is a configuration that allows you to remove files/folders from system. You can
                        place a
                        file named debloater.config in <code>/sdcard/NikGapps</code> folder and add the folder name/file
                        path that you want to remove and flash latest version of
                        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/NikGapps/files/Releases/Debloater/">Debloater Zip</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Debloater recognizes the folder names that you
                        want to delete in priv-app or app folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can Just enter the name of the folder you want
                        to delete. For e.g. YouTube. This would remove the YouTube folder
                        wherever it is located in <code>/system/app</code>,
                        <code>/system/priv-app</code>, <code>/system/product/app</code>,
                        <code>/system/product/priv-app</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you want to delete a specific file/folder you can enter full
                        path. For e.g. <code>/system/app/YouTube</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, the above one wouldn't work in case of SAR device since the
                        partition path you're looking for can be
                        <code>/system_root/system/app/YouTube</code> or
                        <code>/system/system/app/YouTube</code>(Hence use the Folder method).

                    Yes, now you can flash NikGapps addons independent of NikGapps.

                Is Addon Package compatible with Android 9 and 10 both?

                        No! Since android 9 and 10 differs in mounting mechanism, NikGapps follows the right
                        standard
                        based on
                        android version you're installing the packages in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flashing android 9 package in 10 and vice-versa will install the app normally. However, it
                        won't
                        work fine
                        after dirty flash. It is recommended to flash appropriate package depending on android
                        version.
